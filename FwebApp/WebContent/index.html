This is the report part of the web page.
The website design I choose was a MVC i Felt it would a cleaner way of implementing a website design.
<br>
The three databases created were JP_USERS, JP_BOOK and JP_ACCOUNT. The User DB had all the users information, 
The Book DB had all the list of books. Finally the account DB had all the list books loaned with Book ID and Student number.
<br>
The functioning parts are the log in , searching the books and adding books to the account.The admin role wasnt implemented.
<br>

The login details are E-mail: pm@mail.ie and Password: pass
